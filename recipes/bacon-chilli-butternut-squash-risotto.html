        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>600g Buternut Squash</li>
            <li>1 Onion</li>
            <li>1 bunch Flat Leaf Parsley</li>
            <li>1/2 Red Chilli</li>
            <li>1 Garlic Clove</li>
            <li>4 Streaky Smoked Bacon Rasher</li>
            <li>40g Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>1 Vegetable Stock</li>
            <li>30g Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>175g Risotto Rice</li>
            <li>1/2 Lemon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <p>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 200 degrees. Cut the butternut squash in half lengthways and scoop out the seeds with a 
                <br>spoon (or a melon baller works well if you have one!). Slice it widthways to about 1cm thick (we want to 
                <br>be able to cook this nice and quickly). Now chop into 1cm cubes.</br>
                </li>
            </p>
          
            <p><li>Put your butternut squash on a baking tray and drizzle over some oil, a sprinkling of salt and a good grind of
                <br>black pepper. Pop in your oven on the top shelf for 25-30 mins. Then remove from your oven and keep to the 
                <br>side.</br>
                </li>
            </p>

            <p>
                <li>Meanwhile, cut the onion in half through the root, peel and chop into ½cm pieces. Roughly chop the parsley. 
                    <br>Cut the red chilli in half lengthways, remove the seeds and finely chop. Peel and grate the garlic (or use 
                    <br>a garlic press if you have one). Cut the bacon into 1cm wide strips (use scissors for this if 
                    <br>you want, it’s much easier!). Grate the parmesan.</br>
                </li>
            </p>

            <p> 
                <li>Put a saucepan of water (amount specified in the ingredient list) on to boil with the vegetable stock pot and 
                    <br>stir to dissolve.</br>
                </li>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <li>Put half the butter in a large saucepan on medium heat along with a drizzle of oil. Add your onion and bacon 
                    <br>and cook for 5 mins until your onion is soft and your bacon browned. Add your chilli (add less if you 
                    <br>don’t like spice) and garlic and cook for 1 minute.</br>
                </li>
            </p>

            <p>
                <li>Once the pan is smelling fragrant and garlicky, add the rice along with a good pinch of salt and a good grind of 
                    <br>black pepper, stir and cook for 1-2 mins until your rice looks slightly translucent around the edges.</br>
                </li>
            </p>

            <p>
                <li>After a minute or two, add in a ladle of your stock, stir, and once absorbed, add another ladle of stock. Keep 
                    <br>the pan on medium heat and continue adding stock (stirring now and again while it cooks), letting it absorb 
                    <br>before adding another ladle. This should take 17-20 mins. Your risotto is ready when your rice is ‘al dente’. 
                    <br>Tip: ‘Al dente’ simply means the rice is cooked through but has a tiny bit of firmness left in the middle.</br>
                </li>
            </p>

            <p>
                <li>Once cooked, remove from the heat and add your butternut squash along with three-quarters of your parmesan, your 
                    <br>remaining butter and three-quarters of your parsley. Squeeze in half the lemon juice, taste and add more lemon 
                    <br>juice, salt and black pepper if necessary.</br>
                </li>
            </p>

            <p>
                <li>Serve your risotto in bowls with the rest of your parsley and parmesan sprinkled over the top.</li>
            </p>
