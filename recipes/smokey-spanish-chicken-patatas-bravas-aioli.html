                <li>1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes</li>
                <li>5g Parsley</li>
                <li>2 tsp Ground Cproander</li>
                <li>2 tsp Smoked Paprika</li>
                <li>1 Red Onion</li>
                <li>1 Red Pepper</li>
                <li>1 Garlic Clove</li>
                <li>1 Tomato</li>
                <li>1 Yellow Pepper</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 6. Cut the potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized cubes.
                   <br>Add the potato cubes to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper
                   <br>Put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until the potatoes are golden and crispy – these are your 
                   <br>crispy potatoes</br>
                </li>
            
                <li>Deseed the peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut them into thick strips.
                    <br>Peel and roughly slice the red onion. Add the pepper strips and sliced onion to a separate baking 
                    <br>tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt. Put the tray in the oven for 20 min or 
                    <br>until the veg is soft and tender.</br>
                </li>

                <li>While the veg is in the oven, boil half a kettle. Dice the tomato. Chop the parsley finely, including 
                    <br>the stalks. Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic. Dissolve the tomato paste in 100ml boiled 
                    <br>water and add the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – this is your spicy tomato stock</br>
                </li>

                <li>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat. 
                    <br>Once hot, add the diced tomato with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 3-4 min or until the tomatoes 
                    <br>have broken down. Add the spicy tomato stock to the pan and cook for 3-4 min further or until thickened – 
                    <br>this is your bravas sauce</br>
                </li>

                <li>While the sauce thickens, cut the chicken breasts in half lengthways. Combine the ground coriander, smoked 
                    <br>paprika, 1 tsp sugar and a generous pinch of salt on a plate – this is your smoky spice mix. 
                    <br>Add the halved chicken breasts to the smoky spice mix and mix until they are fully coated – this is your 
                    <br>coated chicken</br>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat.
                <br>Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until the chicken is slightly blackened 
                <br>on the outside and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your smoky Spanish-style chicken.</br>
                </li>

                <li>Meanwhile, combine the mayo, chopped garlic, 1 tsp [2 tsp] cold water and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – 
                    <br>this is your aioli. Once the veg is cooked, add the chopped parsley to the tray and give everything a good 
                    <br>mix up – this is your roasted veg. Serve the smoky Spanish-style chicken with the crispy potatoes and roasted 
                    <br>veg to the side. Top the crispy potatoes with the bravas sauce – these are your patatas bravas.</br>
                    
                    <p>Drizzle the aioli all over the patatas bravas</p>
                    
                    <p>Enjoy!</p>
